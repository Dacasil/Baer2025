# Onboard Quest - Improve Client Onboarding Efficiency in Private Banking using Machine Learning and Gamification

## Introduction:

#### What is the current problem?
In private banking, the onboarding process requires verifying client information against a set of regulatory rules to ensure compliance. This manual process is often time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays and a poor customer experience. Inconsistencies in documentation represent another major challenge. Onboarding can involve analysing 200-300 pages of information and contracts, where discrepancies are not only common but also significantly impact efficiency. Document and data analysis may seem mundane, but the pain today is substantial. 

#### What is the expected final product?
The expectation is to develop a comprehensive ML model that can support Relationship Managers and compliance functions to ensure all onboarding rules are duly met during client onboarding, enhanced with gamification elements so the journey is efficient and more entertaining. 

#### Who are the users of this solution?
* Relationship Managers
* Compliance functions (1st line of defense, 2nd line of defense) 
* Clients (tbd)?

#### Use Case: 
* There is a lot of back and forth between RM and clients and risk employees, so we want to improve the efficiency of the client onboarding via AI and machine learning model. 

## Expected Outcome:

The expectation is to develop a comprehensive ML model that can support Relationship Managers and compliance functions to ensure all onboarding rules are duly met during client onboarding, enhanced with gamification elements so the journey is efficient and more entertaining.
